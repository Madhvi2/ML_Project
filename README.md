# ML_Project
We approached the task of identifying a user’s physical activity, by analyzing gait patterns, as captured from accelerometer sensor, present in the user’s mobile device. After pre-processing, we calculated some basic statistical features ( Mean, Std. Dev., Variance, Correlation ) and some frequency domain features( Mean Energy, Information Entropy ), to formulate our feature- set. The Mean value, represent the DC component of the acceleration values, while the std. dev. and variance, represent the range. Correlation, acts as a additional measure, to distinguish between activities with same energy. The pairwise values, because of the configuration of the human, during the different activities, turns out to be different.
We apply multiple ML techniques to the feature-set calculated and present our results. The results, provide enough motivation, for the work to be carried further and improved upon.
